               <ul>
                   <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>I started the company with the objective of helping startups and mature enterprises in every aspect of life- it's not restricted to business. We all have common personality traits that get hidden often running after excel sheets and deliverables.</li>
                 <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Often over the top statements from founders on their profile to attract business is a big NO for me. I know the reality- a prolonged pain process. Clients chasing one department to another with poor communication hierarchy.</li>
                 <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>When your systems are broken, delivery will be disastrous.
                  </li><li><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>I have worked in different roles as customer support representative, technical writing and marketing for IT service companies.</li>

When you are doing business, it runs on #1 thing called trust. Relationships are developed over time. You have to earn it. When you solve your clients pressing need, you become a partner, not just another vendor.</li>
                  <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>I never overstate our capabilities and miscommit. If you are direct and honest, people will copy your positive traits.</li>
                  <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>I personally like eating healthy food, doing meditation, love sports and watch action thrillers.</li>
