         <h2 class="section-heading">Every Business Needs a Website and a Mobile App. Why?</h2>
         <p>Your website is the face value of your company. It is not just replicating a WordPress or Shopify theme. You cannot ignore its importance in this DNA. 
            A strong online presence will enable you to become a market leader in your niche. 
            If you are building a mobile application, you cannot wait countless hours to launch a product. You must first validate the product and get the MVP out to get feedback. 
            Only a strong technology team who understands the start up vibe will deliver on promise.
